APM504: Applied Probability
=============================

Taught by Jay Taylor
Coded by Levi John Wolf

this is a repository for Jay Taylor's Applied Probability course. 

The practicals will be stored under the practical number (01, 02, etc) and will
consist of the code needed to solve the practical problems. 

In many cases, the data used or simulations aren't added due to size
constraints. 

Otherwise, to view the code, simply click on the practical in the Github branch
view above.
